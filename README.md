# Problem 1:
Take the standard MNIST handwritten digit dataset, and as usual, split it into training and testing data. Treat each image as a vector. For all the test images, calculate the nearest neighbor from the training data, and report this label as the prediction. </br>
How accurate is this method?</br>
What metric did you use for distance?</br>
How fast/slow is your implementation? can you analyze the bottlenecks and speed things up?</br>
Any ideas on improving accuracy?</br>

# Problem 2:
Look up what the Arithmetic-Geometric mean of two numbers is. </br>
Given two numbers, calculate their AGM </br>
Decide on a range of numbers and for every pair in this range, calculate their AGM and plot it</br>
